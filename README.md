# PDFKit testing

`npm run dev` to run in development mode. You can preview the document in browser by opening index.html.

`npm start <amount>` to generate PDF files. Default value for amount is 1 and it is limited to 1000. You can change these from index.js

`npm run clear` to delete the PDF files. Do this also in the beginning to create the documents folder where all the PDFs will be saved.
